# CA4 Model

A light-color resource competition model for phytoplankton in blue-green ocean environments.

Competition is between specialist phytoplankton that absorb blue or green light, and generalists phytoplankton that undergo Type IV Chromatic Acclimation (CA4) and change photosynthetic pigments to absorb either blue or green light.

CA4 is only observed in the marine cyanobacteria genus *Synechococcus*. The biology involves changing the ratio of chromophores of phycoerythrin: phycourobilin, PUB (max absorption at 495 nm) to phycoerythrobilin, PEB (max absorption at 545 nm) in the phycobilisome light-harvesting antenna of the cell. PUB:PEB goes up in blue light, and down in green light. Additionally, the ratio of phycoerythrin to chlorophyll-a goes down in blue-light.

Model code is based on modified equations and theory published by [Stomp et al., 2008](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/591680)
